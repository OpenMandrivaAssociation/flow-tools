# Every line is basically just the options to flow-capture, see
# flow-capture(1) for explanation.

# Example 1:
# Capture flows from router at 10.1.1.10, listening at port 3000.
# Store flows in /var/lib/flow-capture/myrouter.
-w /var/lib/flow-capture/myrouter 0/10.1.1.10/3000

# Example 2:
# Capture flows from router at 10.3.2.6, listening at port 3002.
# Store flows in /var/lib/flow-capture/mysecondrouter. Rotate files every
# 5 minutes.
-w /var/lib/flow-capture/mysecondrouter -n 275 0/10.3.2.6/3002

# Example 3:
# Same as above, but only listen at address 10.3.2.5, and store
# files under 'YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD' directories.
-w /var/lib/flow-capture/mysecondrouter -n 275 -N 3 10.3.2.5/10.3.2.6/3002
